# Proactive-and-Reactive-Measures-for-Adversarial-Defense

In this project we aim to study the effects of reactive andproactive attacks as an adversarial defense particularly ona base reactive defense(PCL as termed in paperrefer) thatmaximally  separates  features  in  intermediate  layers  in  adeep learning model.   Also,  we study the effects of imagetransformations on feature space and adversarial exampletransferability.
