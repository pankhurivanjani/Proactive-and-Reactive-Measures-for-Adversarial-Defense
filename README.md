# Proactive-and-Reactive-Measures-for-Adversarial-Defense

In this project we aim to study the effects of reactive and proactive attacks as an adversarial defense particularly ona base reactive defense (PCL as termed in paper refer) that maximally  separates  features  in  intermediate  layers  in  a deep learning model.   Also,  we study the effects of image transformations on feature space and adversarial example transferability.
